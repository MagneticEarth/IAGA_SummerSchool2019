    "# 1. Calculating K-indices for a single observatory\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-index is a global geomagnetic activity index devised by Julius Bartels in 1938 to give a simple measure of the degree of geomagnetic disturbance during each 3-hour (UT) interval. It uses data from ground-based magnetometers to assign a number in the range 0-9 to interval, with K=0 indicating very little geomagnetic activity and K=9 representing an extreme geomagnetic storm. The K-index was introduced at the time of photographic recording, when magnetograms recorded variations in the horizontal geomagnetic field elements declination (D) and horizontal intensity (H), and in the vertical intensity (Z). To derive a K-index an observer would fit, by eye, a quiet-time curve to the records of D and H and measure the range (maximum-minimum) of the deviation of the recording from the curve. The K-index was then assigned according to a conversion table, with the greatest range in D and H 'winning'. The north component (X) may be used instead of H, and the east component (Y) instead of D (X and Y will be used in the examples below). The vertical component Z is not used because it is liable to contamination by local induced currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion from range in nanoteslas to index is quasi-logarithmic. The conversion table varies with latitude in an attempt to normalise the K-index distribution for observatories at different latitudes. The table for Eskdalemuir is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| K | 0 | 1 |2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Lower bound (nT) | 0 | 8 |15|30|60|105|180|300|500|750|\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, for instance, K=2 if the measured range is in the interval \\[15, 30\\] nT.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a VERY long debate in IAGA Division V about algorithms that could adequately reproduce the K-indices that an experienced observer would assign. The algorithms and code approved by IAGA are available at the International Service for Geomagnetic Indices: http://isgi.unistra.fr/softwares.php. (Also http://isgi.unistra.fr/what_are_kindices.php)"

    "In the following cells, we **illustrate** the process. A simple approach is to assume the so-called regular daily variation $S_R$ is made up of 24h, 12h and 8h signals (and, possibly, higher harmonics). A Fourier analysis can be used to investigate this. The functions in the cell below calculate Fourier coefficients from a data sample, and then synthesise a Fourier series using the coefficients.\n",
